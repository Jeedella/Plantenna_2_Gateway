# Project Plant Sensing System - Raspberry Pi Gateway - local storage
In the first release we will save the data from the pi in a .csv file.
This is stored as a string of text that can be accessed.
an example of the way this works is in localstoragecsv.py

this is not properly integrated but we will focus on the implementation of the database in the future.
If the database ends up not being an optimal solution we can always come back and integrate the csv.
This works by saving the data as strings of text separated by a comma. This file would be easily viewable using excel or similiar programs since it is a csv.




## Current status
