This repository contains all code, guides and other necessary information for the gateway of the Smart Plant Monitoring System (SPMS) Fontys project./
The gateway is split into 2 parts: 1). BLE network, and 2). local_storage + IoT connection. The BLE network will be upgraded to a BLE mesh network in later versions. See corresponsing subdirectories and README for more information./
